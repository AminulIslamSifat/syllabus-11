There are three factors that is effecting the solubility of gases in the water:

1. [[Nature of the components]]
2. [[Temperature]]
3. [[Pressure]]


The relationship between pressure and solubility of gases in a particular solvent was investigated by William Henry. And the generalization of his research form a law name [[Henry's Law]]. Which explains the solubility of gases with the changes of the pressure.

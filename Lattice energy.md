Lattice energy is the energy released when 1 mole of an ionic solid forms from its gaseous ions. Or the amount of energy absorbed when 1 mole of ionic compound breaks down to its ion form.

The higher the lattice energy the higher the stability of the compound.

### Factors effecting the lattice energy
[[Temperature]]
There are some factors that can affect the lattice energy for a compound. Such as - 
1. The charge of the ions: The higher the charge of the ions the stronger the bond and higher lattice energy.
2. The size of the ions: The smaller the ions the higher the lattice energy.

The amount of lattice energy mainly depends on the strength of the bond. As higher charges forms a stronger electrostatic forces and smaller size also reduces the r (which increases the attraction forces) it makes the lattice energy higher.

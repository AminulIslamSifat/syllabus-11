A substances dissolve in solvent in two steps:

1. Breaking down to ion: Most of the substances normally remain as compound, but so dissolve in the solvent they need to break down to the ions. 
   As the compound are bond after absorbing energy and the amount of that energy is called lattice energy, so to break down the compound same amount of energy must be provided.
   
   This process is always endothermic.

1. Hydration of Ions: The Ions of the substances must be hydrated or surrounded by the solvent molecule to dissolve. And this process release energy.
   This process is always exothermic.

*If hydration energy > lattice energy, then substances dissolve easily*
*In reverse the substances solubility remain low*

Temperature has significant effects on solubility of a substances in a solvent

### Gas Liquid system

*Dissolution of gas in water is an exothermic process*. So naturally if the temperature increases the solubility of the substances decreases and vice versa. 
When temperature increases the particle of a solvent gains extra movement speed and they are high likely to escape from the solution, which lessen the solubility of the gases.


### Solid Liquid system

In case of solid liquid system, generally the solubility of a substances increases with the temperature. 

There are some exceptional case where this is not followed. 
*Dissolution of solid in liquid is an endothermic process in most of the cases*

A crystal solid dissolved in water with two steps:
1.  Breaking the crystal lattice

- The ions in the solid are bound together with strong forces. And it contains a large amount of energy which is called [[Lattice energy]].
- When breaking down the bond the same amount of energy must be provided to overcome those forces and braking down the bonds.
- This whole process is endothermic.

1. Hydration of the ions

- The free ions now become surrounded by the water molecules.
- This process is exothermic.
- The amount of energy released are called [[Hydration energy]].

If hydration energy >> lattice energy then the substances dissolves easily as there is no need to collect or rely on external energy.  *Most of the cases of the solid liquid system is on this section*

And if hydration energy << lattice energy then the substances is not easily got dissolved as it has to rely on external energy to break down to ion.

Pressure only effects the solubility in gas liquid system.

In the liquid and solid the effectiveness of pressure is so low that it is almost nothing compared to gases, thus in most cases its been neglected.

In a gas liquid system the gas dissolved in the solvent and the gas in the system maintain a equilibrium. And it follows the La Chatelier principle.

*If pressure increases then the solubility of gas in the solvent increases.*
*If pressure decreases then the solubility of gas in the solvent decreases too.*

There is a law named [[Henry's Law|henry's law]] which represents the relationship between Solubility of gas and pressure.

The composition or concentration of a solution can be defines as the amount of solute present in a given amount of solvent or solution.

Thus the concentration of solution can be expressed by,

			C = amount of solute / amount of solvent or solution


Concentration or composition of a solution can be expressed in many different ways:

1. Molarity: Molarity can be defined as the amount of mole of solute present per liter of solvent. 
2. Molality: Molality can be defined as the amount of mole of solute present per 1000 gram of solvent.
3.  Normality: Normality can be defined as the amount of gram equivalent of solute present per liter of solvent.
4. Mole fraction: Mole fraction can be defined as the ratio of number of mole of solute to the number of moles in solution.
5.  Percent by weight: It is defined as the weight of the solute with comparison with solution




## Molarity

Molarity is expressed by C, and the equation to find molarity is:

$$
C = \frac{w x 1000}{M x V}
$$
where, 
- w - weight of the solute
-  M - Molecular weight of the solute
- V - The volume of the solution 
	- **Solution not solvent**

## Molality

Molality is expressed by C<sub>m</sub> and the equation is,

$$
C_m = \frac{w x 1000}{W x M}
$$
where, 
- w - weight of solute
- W - weight of the solvent


## Normality

Normality is expressed by N and the equation is 

$$
N = \frac{w x 1000}{E x V}
$$
where, 
- E - gram equivalent weight of solute

## Mole Fraction

Mole fraction is represented by X and the formula to find mole fraction is 

$$
X = \frac{mole \quad of \quad the \quad solute \quad or \quad solvent}{Total \quad mole \quad count \quad of \quad the \quad solution}
$$

## Percent by weight

This can be represented in various types

like:
1. w/w
2. w/v
3. v/v
where,
- w - weight
- v - volume

and the measurement formula is:
 $$
 \text{percent of solute by weight} = \frac{\text{weight \quad of \quad solute}}{\text{weight \quad of \quad solvent}} x 100
 $$

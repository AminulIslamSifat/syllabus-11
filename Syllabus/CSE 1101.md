Title: Structured Programming

Basic Concept:

1.  Basic idea of algorithm
2.  How compiling work?
3.  Program debugging
4.  Definition and difference of Compiler and Interpreter

Baby step:

1.  Basic I/0 and formatted I/O ) [I: Input, O: Output]
2.  Different data types and their size
3.  Operators along with their order and behaviors
4.  Operation, Expression and Expression evaluation
5.  Conditional Logic [If-else, switch-case, ternary]
6.  ASCII value of character (use your brain)
7.  Character usage and tricks by using it as integer

Loop:

1.  For loop
2.  While loop
3.  do-while loop
4.  Usage of continue and break operation
5.  Nested loop

Array:

1.  Different type and style of declaration and initialization
2.  Multi-dimensional array
3.  Array manipulation [indices, enumerate, divide, concatenation, search, sort]
4.  Array of pointer

String:

1.  String operation [concatenation, compare etc.]
2.  Difference between string and character array
3.  Importance of string and null (\0) character
4.  String I/O
5.  Array of string

Pointer
(The gate of madness along with reality check)

1.  Introduction and understanding of pointer
2.  Pointer operation
3.  Pointers of array
4.  Array of pointer

Function:

1.  Defining and calling method of user-defined function
2.  Void functions with no parameter
3.  Return type and parameter of function
4.  Call by values
5.  Function with pointer as parameter
6.  Scope of variable [Local and Global]
7.  Built-in function
8.  Recursive function
9.  Array as parameter
10.  Call by reference

Custom Data Types:

1.  Structures
2.  Unions
3.  Enumerations

File:

1.  Basic file operation [Opening, Closing]
2.  Updating binary and sequential files
3. Files I/O

Advanced Topics:
(I have no idea from where those guys came)

1. Operation on bits
2.  Preprocessors and macros

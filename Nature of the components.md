### Like dissolves like

Same type of solute and solvent are likely so dissolves than different type. such that a polar substance is soluble in polar solvent and a non polar substances in soluble in non polar solvent. Vice versa is not always possible. For example, even though NaCl is soluble in water, it is not soluble in benzene and CCl<sub>4</sub> is soluble in benzene but not soluble in water.

In case of gas liquid system, if the gas react with the solvent or ionized in the solvent than the solubility for that gas will be higher than a non reactive gas.

The solubility of a gas in pure solvent is higher than electrolytic solution
- In electrolytic solution, some of the water molecule is already occupied with the electrolytic ion. Thus, they can not perform in gas absorption, as a result the solubility of gases in that solution are lower than pure solvent.

*The volume of the solvent slightly increases with the dissolution of gases*

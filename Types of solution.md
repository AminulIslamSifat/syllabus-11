1. Mixture: A mixture is a combination of two or more mutually non reactive substances.
   example: sand and sugar mixture
   
   There are two types of mixture based on the physical condition of substances
	   1. [[Homogeneous mixture]]
	   2. [[ Heterogeneous mixture]]
	   
2. Solution: A solution is a homogeneous mixture of mutually non-reactive two or more substances. 

*Solution is a type of mixture. when mixture can be both homogeneous and heterogeneous, solution must have to be homogeneous*

Solution must contains at least two substances. Solution must contain
- Solute : In solution the substance which has lower amount are called solute
- Solvent: In solution the substances which has higher amount are called solvent

### Types of solution

There are six types of solution depending on their substances physical phases

*solute* - *solvent*
1. gas - gas, e.g. Air
2.  gas - solid, e.g. Absorption of H<sub>2</sub> in platinum
3.  gas - liquid, e.g. CO<sub>2</sub>
4.  liquid - liquid, e.g. Acid in water
5. liquid - solid, e.g. Mercury in silver
6.  solid - solid, e.g. [[Metal alloys]]
7.  solid - liquid, e.g. salt or sugar in water


[[Different Units of Concentration]] : The composition or concentration of a solution can be defined as the amount of solute present per given amount of solvent.

The relationship between solubility of gas and the pressure in a particular solvent was investigated by William Henry. And the generalized form of his investigation is called Henry's Law.

The law states that,
	"For a gas in contact with a solvent in a constant temperature, the concentration of the gas that dissolves in the solvent is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas applied on the solvent surface."

Mathematically this law can be represented by,

$$
C \quad = KxP
$$
where, 
	C = The concentration of the gas that dissolves in the solvent
	K = Proportionality constant known as Henry's law constant
	P = Pressure of the gas applied on the liquid surface.

The law has some limitation too, they are represented below:
	1. This law is only applicable with near ideal gases.
	2.  This law works in moderate temperature and pressure. In high temperature and pressure this law failed to produce correct result.
	3. The solubility of the gas must be low in the solvent.
	4. The gas must not react with the solvent.
	5. The gas must remain in the same molecular form in the solvent. In cant be dissociated or associated in the solvent.

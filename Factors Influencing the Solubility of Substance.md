It can be happened that a solute is soluble in one type of solvent but not soluble in another type.

NaCl is soluble in water but it is not soluble in benzene.

There is a saying that **Like dissolves like**, which means same types of solute and solvent dissolves well together.

*Polar solute dissolve in polar solvent and non polar solute dissolves in non polar solvent*
Such as NaCl is soluble in water and CCl<sub>4</sub> is soluble in benzene.

### Factors effecting the solubility

There are three factor that can effect the solubility of a solute
1. [[Nature of the components]]
2. [[Temperature]]
3. [[Pressure]]
